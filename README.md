# ELAN Transcription to Orthography

This is an application that runs into ELAN file Makurap language IPA transcription normalization into current orthography. It is expected that the ELAN file already has the necessary tiers, as no tiers are written. If there are already annotations at the tier where the orthography comes, those are not overwritten. 

The transformation is rule based and can be easily adapted and improved.
